\title{K-Nearest Neighbors with Random Tie-Breaking}
\usage{
get_knn(X, Knn)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix where each row represents a data point and each
column represents a feature (coordinate). If not a matrix, it will be coerced to one.}

\item{Knn}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to find
for each point.}
}
\value{
An integer matrix of dimension \code{n x Knn} where \code{n} is the
  number of rows in \code{X}. Each row \code{i} contains the indices
  (in 1-based R indexing) of the \code{Knn} nearest neighbors of point \code{i}.
}
\description{
Finds k-nearest neighbors for each point in a dataset, with special handling
for duplicate points and random sampling when multiple points are equidistant
(tied) at the k-th nearest neighbor distance.
}
\details{
This function combines the fast k-nearest neighbor search from the RANN package
with custom C++ code to handle two special cases:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Duplicate points}: When multiple points have identical coordinates,
    they are grouped and neighbors are randomly sampled from the group.
  \item \strong{Tied distances}: When multiple points are equidistant at the k-th
    nearest neighbor position, the function randomly samples which points to include
    as neighbors.
}

The random sampling ensures unbiased neighbor selection and is useful for
statistical applications where deterministic tie-breaking could introduce bias.
}
\note{
This function requires the compiled C++ function \code{handle_duplicates_and_ties_cpp}
to be available. Use \code{Rcpp::sourceCpp()} to compile the associated C++ code
before calling this function.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create sample data with some duplicate points
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 5)
X [ 10:15, ] <- X[ 1, ]  # Add duplicates

# Find 5 nearest neighbors with random tie-breaking
nn_indices <- get_knn(X, Knn = 5)

# The results will differ between runs when ties exist
nn_indices2 <- get_knn(X, Knn = 5)
sum(nn_indices != nn_indices2)  # Shows differences due to random tie-breaking
}
