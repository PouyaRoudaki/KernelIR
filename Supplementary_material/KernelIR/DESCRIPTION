Description: This package implements a new kernel-based measure of statistical dependence between random variables. It provides two complementary estimators: 1.KNN graph–based estimator 2.RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space)–based estimator. The framework is fully nonparametric and is designed to detect general nonlinear and non-monotonic dependence structures.
