\title{K-Nearest Neighbors with Random Tie-Breaking}
\usage{
get_knn(X, Knn)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix where each row represents a data point and each
column represents a feature (coordinate). If not a matrix, it will be coerced to one.}

\item{Knn}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to find
for each point.}
}
\value{
An integer matrix of dimension \code{n x Knn} where \code{n} is the
  number of rows in \code{X}. Each row \code{i} contains the indices
  (in 1-based R indexing) of the \code{Knn} nearest neighbors of point \code{i}.
}
\description{
Finds k-nearest neighbors for each point in a dataset, with special handling
for duplicate points and random sampling when multiple points are equidistant
(tied) at the k-th nearest neighbor distance.
}
\details{
This function combines the fast k-nearest neighbor search from the RANN package
with custom C++ code to handle two special cases:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Duplicate points}: When multiple points have identical coordinates,
    they are grouped and neighbors are randomly sampled from the group.
  \item \strong{Tied distances}: When multiple points are equidistant at the k-th
    nearest neighbor position, the function randomly samples uniformly
    from the full tied set.
}

The random sampling ensures unbiased neighbor selection and is useful for
statistical applications where deterministic tie-breaking could introduce bias.
}
\note{
This function requires the compiled C++ function
\code{knn_tie_duplicate_aware_cpp} to be available.

\examples{
### 1) No duplicates, no ties (deterministic)
X <- matrix(c(0, 1, 3, 6, 10), ncol = 1)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)

### 2) Symmetric tie case
X <- matrix(c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2), ncol = 1)
set.seed(1)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)
set.seed(2)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)

### 3) Small duplicate group
X <- matrix(c(0, 0, 1, 2, 3), ncol = 1)
set.seed(1)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)

### 4) Large duplicate block (> Knn)
X <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 7), ncol = 1)
set.seed(1)
nn1 <- get_knn(X, Knn = 3)
set.seed(2)
nn2 <- get_knn(X, Knn = 3)
nn1
nn2

### 5) Large boundary tie set
X <- matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5), ncol = 1)
set.seed(1)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)

### 6) Evenly spaced grid (frequent ties)
X <- matrix(c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), ncol = 1)
set.seed(1)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)

### 7) Small n edge case
X <- matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 3), ncol = 1)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)

### 8) Duplicates + symmetric ties combined
X <- matrix(c(-1, 0, 0, 0, 1), ncol = 1)
set.seed(1)
get_knn(X, Knn = 3)
